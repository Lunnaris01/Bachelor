%%% Zusammenfassung:
Deep Reinforcement Learning and policy gradient methods majorly contributed to the most recent advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
These Methods enabled machines to surpass human performance for Atari console games \citep{mnih2015atari}, boardgames like Chess, Shogi \citep{Shogi17} or Go \citep{Go2017} and most recently even complex team-based computer games \citep{OpenAI_dota}.

Simulating complex environments like the Atari console games can be 

The goal of this thesis is the implementation and evaluation of the "Actor-Critic with Experience Replay"(ACER) algorithm proposed by \cite{ACER} on the Atari console games.
